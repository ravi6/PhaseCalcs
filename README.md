Here is an example of how phase equillibria calculations of an non-ideal gas mixture can be done with the use of PengRobinson's state equation.
While the calculation of bubble and dew point calculations appear very
straight forward, the calculations get tricky near critical point requiring special numerical techniques near those regions. This part is not yet addressed at this stage.
Phase calculations are done with octave engine, while the user interface is
provided through web page that can be served by a miniHTTP server and php backend.
